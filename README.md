# Image-Editor
Allows editing PBM, PGM and PPM files.

Supports creating new images, as well as cropping, resizing (scaling) and dithering.

## Resizing Algorithm
The following [resizing algorithm](https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~masc1044/L17-Rotation/ScalingNN.html) is used.

## Dithering Algorithms
The program supports [11 dirhering algorithms](https://tannerhelland.com/2012/12/28/dithering-eleven-algorithms-source-code.html).

It creates a black and white image of the same file type as the original one.
